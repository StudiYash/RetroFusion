# Backend Execution ðŸš€

Welcome to the **Backend Execution** folder of the **Bounceario** project! This folder houses the progressive backend code that powers the game. Developed iteratively through a series of 23 "Progression Mark" files, each mark documents the step-by-step evolution of Bouncearioâ€”gradually integrating new features and improvements until the final, complete version is achieved.

## Requirements

Before running or exploring the backend code, ensure you have the following:
- **Python 3.10** (or later) installed on your system.
- **Pygame** and **Tkinter** libraries for handling game logic, rendering, and the splash screen.
- **Pillow** for image processing.
- A suitable development environment (e.g., your local machine or a virtual environment) to run Python scripts.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the complete Bounceario repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/StudiYash/RetroFusion.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Backend Folder**
   Change directory to the Project Backend folder:

   ```bash
   cd RetroFusion/Project Games/Sub-Project 01 - Bounceario/Project Backend
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame pillow
   ```

4. **Explore the Progression Marks**
   The Game Progression Files folder contains 23 Python files, each labeled as Progression Mark 01 through Progression Mark 23. These files illustrate the incremental development of Bouncearioâ€”from an initial prototype to the fully integrated game.

## Running the Code

To run the backend code for Bounceario, execute the latest progression mark (e.g., Progression Mark 23 Final.py), which contains the final version of the game for v1.0.0:

```bash
python "Game Progression Files/Progression_Mark_23_Final.py"
```

## Important Notes

- **Incremental Development:**
Each of the 24 Progression Marks demonstrates a key milestone in the gameâ€™s development. This approach ensures a clean and maintainable codebase with a clear evolution path.
- **Modularity & Testing:**
Each mark focuses on adding or refining specific features. If you modify or extend the project further, consider testing individual marks to ensure the integrity of each component.
- **Non-Commercial Use:**
Bounceario is developed strictly for educational and non-commercial purposes. All assets and code snippets are used in accordance with their original licenses.

**Happy coding, and enjoy playing the Bounceario!**
