# Project Games ðŸš€

Welcome to the **Project Games** section of **RetroFusion**!  
This area of the repository is dedicated to all the retro-inspired game subprojects that form part of the RetroFusion umbrella project. Each subproject is a standalone game that contributes to the overall vision of reviving classic 2D gaming with a modern, open-source twist.

## About RetroFusion Subprojects

RetroFusion is an open-source initiative created for educational and non-commercial purposes. We encourage developers and enthusiasts to contribute their own games under this umbrella, following the shared guidelines and using the same legal and ethical standards. Each game is self-contained yet benefits from the collective ecosystem, allowing you to learn, collaborate, and build your portfolio.

## Current Subprojects

Below is a table listing the current subprojects. As new games are developed, they will be added here to keep the RetroFusion ecosystem dynamic and evolving.
