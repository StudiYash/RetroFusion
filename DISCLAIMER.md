**RetroFusion** is an open-source, community-driven project created for **educational and non-commercial purposes** only. It serves as an umbrella for multiple subprojects housed under the `Project Games/` directory. Each subproject is an independently developed game contributed by the original creator or members of the open-source community. These games are meant to demonstrate creative, experimental, and learning-focused game development within the RetroFusion ecosystem.
