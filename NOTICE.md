# NOTICE

This project, **RetroFusion**, is a community-driven open-source initiative created for **educational and non-commercial purposes** only.

RetroFusion serves as an umbrella for multiple independently developed subprojects (games), all located within the `Project Games/` directory. Each subproject may have its own creative direction, contributors, and assets. As such, third-party content usage may vary across subprojects.

## General Acknowledgements

RetroFusion and its subprojects may be inspired by a variety of classic and modern video games, including those developed by companies such as Nintendo, Sega, Atari, and others. These inspirations are **creative and thematic**, and do not involve direct duplication of proprietary assets unless otherwise stated.

We wish to acknowledge the influence of:
- Classic 2D platformers (e.g., Super Mario Bros, Sonic the Hedgehog, Mega Man)
- Retro arcade aesthetics and mechanics
- Pixel art and sound design from the retro gaming era

These acknowledgements are made purely to recognize creative influence and **do not imply any affiliation, endorsement, or sponsorship** from the respective trademark or copyright holders.

## Project-Specific Notices

Each game within the RetroFusion ecosystem may include third-party assets such as:
- Royalty-free sound effects and music
- Free-to-use pixel art assets
- Fonts, tilesets, or libraries from open-source platforms

All subprojects are expected to document their own third-party asset usage clearly.

> For asset usage details specific to individual games, please refer to the `NOTICE.md` file inside each subproject folder under `Project Execution/`.
